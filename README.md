# Smart_Alarm
Smart house alarm made with arduino components. I have used an Arduino UNO board to build an alarm that can detect when a door opens.
The alarm is controlled from an Android app made with Android Studio. The bluetooth module that I'm using is HC-05.
I've attached both the Arduino code and the Android Studio code for you. Thanks for visiting =)
